<p>Generally we recommend only allow authenticated site members to post comments to avoid spam. However if you allow anonymous posting of comments you can enable a captcha that the user has to solve in order to post a comment. This can significantly reduce unwanted spam comments posted by automated scripts. This setting only works with the internal comment system.</p>
